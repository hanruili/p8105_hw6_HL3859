The distribution of R-squared values from the bootstrap samples is
approximately normal, centered around 0.91. The density curve suggests
that most of the estimates are concentrated near 0.91, with a slight
tail extending toward lower values. This indicates that the linear model
explains a majority of the variance in the relationship between tmin and
tmax.

```

![](p8105_hw6_HL3859_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

The distribution of the log of the product of the intercept and the tmin
variable is also approximately normal, with values centered around 2.0.
The peak density indicates a high concentration of estimates around this
value, and the distribution has a slight tail on the higher end. This
suggests the log-transformed product of the intercept and tmin is
consistent across the bootstrap samples.

The residuals vs. fitted values plot shows that while the model fits
most of the data well (with residuals clustered around zero), there are
concerns regarding heteroscedasticity, especially for larger fitted
values. This could indicate that the model fails to capture the
relationship in higher birthweight observations effectively.

The density plot and Q-Q plot indicate that residuals are roughly
normally distributed, but with heavy tails. This means that while the
model captures most of the data adequately, there are extreme
observations that are not well-fitted.

- Model 1: The narrow spread suggests that Model 1 has more consistent
  prediction accuracy across different splits of the data. Its lower
  central RMSE implies that it generally performs better in terms of
  minimizing prediction error compared to the other models.

- Model 2 (simple): The greater width of the distribution indicates that
  the model’s prediction accuracy is more variable across the different
  cross-validation folds. The higher median RMSE suggests that the
  simpler model with fewer predictors does not fit the data well enough,
  resulting in consistently higher prediction errors. This model lacks
  the complexity needed to effectively capture the factors influencing
  birthweight, leading to poorer predictions.

- Model 3 (complex): While Model 3 incorporates more complexity through
  interaction terms, this does not appear to significantly reduce RMSE
  compared to Model 1. The narrow spread indicates that Model 3 has
  relatively consistent performance, but the central RMSE value being
  similar or slightly higher than Model 1 suggests that the added
  interaction terms may not have provided much practical improvement,
  and possibly led to overfitting.

Overall, Model 1 (my model) is the best model among the three, providing
a good trade-off between complexity and performance. It achieves the
lowest RMSE while maintaining consistency across the cross-validation
folds.
